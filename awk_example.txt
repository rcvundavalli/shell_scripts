FS (field separator): By default, this is any whitespace (spaces or tabs)
RS (record separator): By default, a newline (\n)
NF (number of fields): When awk parses a line, this variable is set to the number of fields that have been parsed
$0: The current record
$1, $2, $3, etc.: The first, second, third, etc. field from the current record
NR (number of records): The number of records that have been parsed so far by the awk script

awk '{print}' employee.txt

awk '/manager/ {print}' employee.txt 

awk '{print $1,$4}' employee.txt

awk '{print NR,$0}' employee.txt ## NR displays line number and $0 is the entire line

awk '{print $1,$NF}' employee.txt  ## Use of NF built-in variables (Display Last Field) 

awk 'NR==3, NR==6 {print NR,$0}' employee.txt  ##Another use of NR built-in variables (Display Line From 3 to 6)  

awk '{print length($0) }' employee.txt  ##length of each line

 awk '{ if (length($0) > max) max = length($0) } END { print max }' employee.txt   ##To find the length of the longest line present in the file
 
 awk 'END { print NR }' employee.txt  ## To find number of lines in a file
 
  awk 'length($0) > 25' employee.txt  ## TPrinting lines with more than 25 characters
  
  awk '{ if($3 == "account") print $0;}' employee.txt ##To find/check for any string in any specific column
  
  ##To print the squares of first numbers from 1 to n say 6:  
  
  awk 'BEGIN { for(i=1;i<=6;i++) print "square of", i, "is",i*i; }'  
  
  
  awk -F":" '{print $1 }' /etc/passwd  ##$1 is the first field in the current record. The -F option sets the FS variable to the character :
  
  awk 'BEGIN { FS=":" } {print $1 }' /etc/passwd   ##The field separator can also be set in a BEGIN function block
  ##every user whose shell is not /sbin/nologin can be printed by preceding the block with a pattern match:
  awk 'BEGIN { FS=":" } ! /\/sbin\/nologin/ {print $1 }' /etc/passwd
