I have a log file that contains 4 different type of exception :
1- Exception
2- Fatal
3- Error
4- Exec
My requirement is to find count of each type of exception..
$ cat -n starting.out
     1    this is line # 1
     2    this is Exception line
     3    this is line # 3
     4    this is Fatal line
     5    this is line # 5
     6    this is Error line
     7    this is Exec line
     8    this is line # 8
     9    this is Error line and Exception line
    10    this is line # 10
    11    this is Exception line
$ perl -lne '$h{$1}++ while(/(Exception|Fatal|Error|Exec)/g)}{print "$v $k" while(($k,$v)=each %h)' starting.out
1 Exec
2 Error
3 Exception
1 Fatal

grep -o -e 'Exec' -e 'Fatal' -e 'Exception' starting.out | sort | uniq -c | sort
##Python Version
file = open("ttls.txt", "r")
data = file.read()
wonder = data.count("wonder")
twinkle = data.count("Twinkle")
print("wonder : {}, Twinkle: {}".format(wonder,twinkle))
file.close()
